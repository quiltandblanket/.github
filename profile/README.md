# Quilt and Blanket

> *Tinkering with code and design*

A small creative practice exploring digital solutions. Sometimes building things, sometimes breaking them, always learning.

*QAB was a design studio in Shanghai (2012-2017). This is... something new.*


## What we are working on

- **WordPress themes & plugins** - Custom solutions for various projects
- **Web apps** - Small tools and experiments with modern frameworks
- **Design systems** - Exploring component libraries and design tokens
- **AI-assisted development** - Learning to work with AI tools effectively


## Notes

- Most repos here are private (work in progress or client projects)
- Experimenting with different approaches to design and code
- Always learning something new

*Feel free to look around, but don't expect too much polish yet.*
